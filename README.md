# $^{90}\mathrm{Y}$ SPECT Scatter Estimation and Voxel Dosimetry in Radioembolization using a Unified Deep Learning Framework

This repository contains the official implementation of [Y90 SPECT Scatter Estimation and Voxel Dosimetry in Radioembolization using a Unified Deep Learning Framework](https://ejnmmiphys.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40658-023-00598-9).

## Pipeline Overview

This study explores a deep-learning-based absorbed dose-rate estimation method for 90Y that mitigates the impact of poor SPECT image quality on dosimetry and the accuracyâ€“efficiency trade-off of Monte Carlo (MC)-based scatter estimation and voxel dosimetry methods.
